## Project Overview, Objectives, and Goals üéÆ
This project aims to develop a time series forecasting model to predict building energy demand for the next 24 hours at 15-minute intervals. The model must generalize to buildings not explicitly included in the training dataset. The ultimate goal is to enhance the accuracy of load forecasts, which directly impacts the efficiency and economics of Fermata‚Äôs V2X-enabled EV battery deployments.

### Objectives:
- Predict 24-hour building energy demand with 15-minute granularity.
- Ensure the model performs well on unseen buildings.
- Support Fermata‚Äôs optimization models by providing precise load forecasts to maximize the economic benefits of V2X technology.

### Problem Significance ‚ö°Ô∏è:
Forecasting building energy load is critical for optimizing the charging and discharging cycles of V2X-enabled EV batteries. Accurate forecasts improve decision-making, reduce costs, and enhance the sustainability of energy systems.

## Methodology üî¢

### Data Collection and Preprocessing:
- Utilized the [ComStock Dataset](https://comstock.nrel.gov/), an open-source simulated dataset for U.S. commercial buildings.
  - Metadata.csv: Building characteristics (building_id, location, type).
  - Load.csv: 15-minute intervals, one-year time series.
  - Weather.csv: Hourly temperature & humidity, one-year time series.
- Addressed challenges such as seasonality, trends, and class imbalance in time-series data.
- One-hot encoded metadata and added engineered features, including heat index, weekday/weekend indicators, and max/min temperature/load per hour.
